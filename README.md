# Opencaching.de - Caches along a route (GUI version)

Runnable JAR files are placed inside the [Releases section](https://github.com/FriedrichFroebel/oc_car-gui/releases).

This is a version of the oc_car script with a graphical user interface, written in Java.

While the original script uses a `.conf` file for saving the configuration, this application uses a XML file. For security reasons the email password is not saved inside the configuration file anymore (by default). By activating the corresponding checkbox, the password can be saved ***unencrypted*** inside the configuration file.

The output is placed inside the home directory inside the folder `occar` by default.
